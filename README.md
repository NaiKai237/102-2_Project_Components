Organization/Structure of Repo:
Standard Node organization with a few files in the main directory for our tracking purposes. Such as a file for the code used for the Postgres Database.

How to Build/Run the Code:
We ran the code just like the labs, you can just use npm to install the packages locally this uses the package files to download all the requirements then you can run it with node start. This will launch the website at localhost:3000. This is very helpful for us to be able to easily track changes. You also need a Postgres Database the commands for that is available in the text file in the main directory of the repo.

Testing:
We tested locally utilizing local servers. Then moved our testing to heroku. We would push to heroku
